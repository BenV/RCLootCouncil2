==== v2.0 (WIP)

* **Complete rewrite**

*  UI overhaul
**    Every frame now follows a standardized layout with support for minimizing.
      It's also made with future customization in mind.

*  Options menu overhaul
**    Master Looter options have been moved to a separate tree and the entire interface have been streamlined.

*  Updated chat commands
**    Most chat commands results in a more appropriate interface than before, while some have been removed.

*  ++Auto pass++
**    By default, RCLootCouncil now auto passes on items certain classes can't use (e.g. plate for priests)
      and items certain classes shouldn't use (e.g. leather for hunters).

*  ++Observe mode++
**    The Master Looter can enable observe mode to let non-council members see the voting frame.

*  ++Autohide in combat++
**    If enabled all RCLootCouncil frames will minimize when entering combat.

*  ++Session setup++
**    The Master Looter is now able to review the list of items before starting a session as well as
      manipulating the list by adding or removing items.

*  ++Award later++
**    Using the session setup, the Master Looter can choose to award items later thus looting the items,
      and have RCLootCouncil start a session later by typing '/rc start'. It's not possible to automatically
      give out items that's already looted, so instead you'll see a list with whom to give the item to.

*  ++Loot from bags++
**    RCLootConcil can now add custom items to a session by typing '/rc add [item(s)]'.

*  ++Localization++
**    All text strings in the addon is now localizable. Head to http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/rclootcouncil/localization/
      to contribuate.

*  ++Ignore list++
**    RCLootCouncil now have a customizable ignore list, for, well, ignoring stuff.

* ++Usage options++
**    More usability to e.g. disable the popup when entering a raid by always accepting it, or
      always rejecting it. Option to turn off the addon temporarily.

*  ++Module support++
**    All frames are implememted as modules, which can be replaced. This also gives the opportunity
      for anyone to add custom features to the core addon.

*  ++Filtering++
**    All responses on the voting frame are now filterable.

*  ++Status text++
**    Everyone in the group is now added to the voting frame with a status text as their response,
      e.g. "Not installed", "Selecting response" and "Candidate removed"

*  ++Diff and roll++
**    Two new columns in the voting frame:
**    "Diff" - which shows the item lvl difference between a candidates' equipped item and the one in session.
**    "Roll" which allows the Master Looter to add a random 1 - 100 roll to all candidates should he so desire.
